        <p>Walking around the streets of New York, you're bound to come across a vendor or two. New York City is home to thousands of vendors, selling all types of goods from hats and sunglasses to produce and halal food. </p>

        <p>However, recently vendors have been dealing with crack downs on their businesses. Due to the city and state limiting the amount of vendors who can receive licenses and permits to vend, those who rely on the business model for their livelihood are at the mercy of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections and the NYPD.</p>
            
       <p> <a href="https://citylimits.org/2022/03/03/nyc-street-vendor-enforcement-back-at-pre-pandemic-levels-despite-shift-away-from-nypd/">City Limits</a> and other publications have reported that crackdowns are on the uptick despite the change in who oversees vendor issues. Most recently, a video of a woman named <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/street-vendors-say-enough-is-enough-after-woman-is-arrested-in-nyc-subway-station-for-selling-fruit/">Maria Falcon</a> went viral after NYPD accosted her for selling fruits in a Brooklyn Subway Station. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/mayor-adams-defends-police-subway-vendor/">Mayor Adams</a> spoke out about the issue, and stated that people need to follow the rules, clearly showing little remorse for the woman. This is not how we should treat people that help our communities run and ask for very little (way less than they should) in return.</p>

        <p>It was found that during the start of the pandemic, when restaurants closed and grocery stores were ransacked, it was street vendors that kept <a href="https://nextcity.org/features/once-upon-a-pandemic-nyc-stopped-antagonizing-street-vendors">communities fed and nurtured</a>. Not to mention that because their produce is significantly marked down commpared to grocery stores like Whole Foods, and grocery delivery apps like FreshDirect, it makes fresh goods more accesible to communities who would otherwise have to rely on <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/5/1/21244391/nyc-street-food-vendor-produce-food-swamp-photo">fast food</a> as their main source of nutrition. Supporting vendors not only helps them, but it helps us as well. The city should not be penalizing them, but instead doing everything they can to make sure these business owners are able to stay in business without risk of harassment.</p>
